      <h1>Hi, I‘m Leandro Oriente,<br> a front end developer at <a href="https://www.dazn.com/">DAZN</a><br> living in Amsterdam.</h1>

      <section class="description">
        <p>Front End Developer with a decade of experience building digital products and teams. Currently working at DAZN on A&R.</p>
        
        <p>I'm a natural leader and besides coding and planning, I like spending time guiding and mentoring new developers. I'm
        also excited about fine-tuning development processes and guidelines, so the team can focus on what matters.</p>
        
        <p>I have extensive experience developing all sorts of Web Applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, and many different
        frameworks, libraries, and technologies.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout my career, I worked mostly with high scalable Softwares, B2B and B2C, built for a global or continental
        audience. I'm also open to experience working on a smaller company with a great team and product vision.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not willing to relocate at the moment.</p>
